# LibEMG_ROS
This is a ROS package that publishes continuous control inputs from an OyMotion GForce armband to a ROS topic. It is based on the [LibEMG]() snake game demo and uses the same training interface. LibEMG supports OyMotion and Myo is no longer available. Please check out the the [Example 1]() from the docs for the original game.

Clone this into a valid catkin workspace to use it.
